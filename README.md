# Udacity-Restaurant-Review-App

Front-End Web Nanodegree Scholarship project 5.

### Project Specification

You have been provided the code for a restaurant reviews website. The code has a lot of issues. It’s barely usable on a desktop browser, much less a mobile device. It also doesn’t include any standard accessibility features, and it doesn’t work offline at all. Your job is to update the code to resolve these issues while still maintaining the included functionality.

### Restaurant Review App Stage 1

convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application

### Task

   - [x] convert a static design to be responsive on different sized displays
   - [x] Implement accessible features for screen reading use
   - [x] add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for your users.

### How to Run

   1. Clone the project and unzip the file.
   2. From the project directory, open the command terminal. (In Windows you can simply type `cmd` in the search bar and hit enter.)
   3. Use Python to launch a local client server. You need Python installed. If needed, download it from Python's [website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and complete installation.
   From inside the new directory, launch a local client server using Python from your terminal: 
    * Python 2: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`
    * Python 3: `python3 -m http.server 8000`. Leave the terminal open.
   4. Visit the site in your browser at http://localhost:8000

### Dependencies

This project uses [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/), a JavaScript library for embedding maps, and [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/), an open-source mapping platform that is free to use.
